Lab 2 - ARM Assembly Practice

This lab is focused on the basics of ARM Assembly. For example:
- How data works in big-endian vs little-endian format.
- How to use assembly code to work around its limitations (ex. matrix addition)
- Gaining familiarity with accessing the memory window

Files in the lab:
- 'Lab2Savo' - lab report that contains my first experience grappling with ARM assembly.
- 'matrix_addition.s' - ARM assembly code to add two 2x2 matrices.

How to run the assembly code:
- Upload the file to a code editor. I used https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm
- Compile & load
