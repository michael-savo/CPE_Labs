Lab 6 - Interrupt Lab Exercise

The learning outcomes for this lab:
• Write an interrupt-driven program using an interrupt service routine (ISR).
• Analyse CPU timing behaviour via debug signals
• Use a debug tool to observe the state of the CPU when entering interrupt handling state.

This lab continues to use the ARM Keil environment and the STM32 Nucleo board. The purpose of this lab is to gain knowledge working in the ARM Keil environment. It allows for the programmer to code in C and also see the assembly code that makes it work. The core part of this lab was using the debugger which allowed us to see the values of the CPU registers and state information. The STM32 board has debugging pins that we connected to the oscilloscope and allowed us to see what is happening physically with voltage and timing.

Files in the lab:
- 'Lab6.pdf' - my groups solutions for the lab along with the debug table.
- 'Lab6Interrupts.pptx' - supplemental slides that explain interrupts and how the ARM Keil environment will be used.
- 'Lab6Project' folder - contains all the files required for this lab to work in the ARM Keil environment.
