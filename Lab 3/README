Lab 3 - More ARM Assembly Practice

This lab continues to focus on the basics of ARM Assembly but gradually introduces ways to implement ideas from high-level programming languages. For example:
- Implementing loops and conditional executions
- Implementing an array which Assembly doesn't natively know how to support unlike C for example.

Files in the lab:
- 'Lab3.pdf' - contains the instructions and groundwork for the lab along with my commentary and code snippets.
- 'Assembly Code' folder - contains the Assembly code files for each part of the lab

How to run the assembly code:
- Upload the file to a code editor. I used https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm
- Compile & load
- Continue (F3)

NOTE: The lab asks to provide corresponding high-level language code for part 3a, but was not required for my submission.
