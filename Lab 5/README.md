Lab 5 - Processing Text in Assembly Language

Learning Outcomes
• Write a mixed C program and assembly language subroutines for the microcontroller.
• Call the subroutines written in assembly in a C function.
• Use Arm register calling conventions when writing subroutines in assembly language.
• Use a suitable debugging tool to view and analyse the processor state.

This lab introduces the ARM Keil environment along with the STM32 Nucleo board. The goal of this lab is to execute assembly code on the STM32 and use the debugger to examine what is happening at the processor level. 

Files in this lab:
- 'Lab5.1_CPU.pdf' - Our written solutions with screenshots from the debugger.
- 'Lab5.1_CPU_ReferenceMaterialOnly.pptx' - Reference material for the STM32 Nucleo board including information like the ARM instruction set.
- 'Lab5.1Project' folder - Includes all required files to make the lab work with the ARM Keil environment.
